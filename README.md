# IoT-Based-Home-Automation
SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) project on an IoT-based home automation system, implemented using the powerful tool, Picsimlab. This project encompasses various functionalities, including controlling garden lights using an LDR module, regulating the temperature inside the home with a cooler and heater, and automating the water tank with inlet and outlet valves.

Firstly, our system incorporates a garden light control feature, which intelligently adjusts the lighting based on the ambient light conditions. The LDR module detects the light intensity and automatically turns on or off the garden lights accordingly, ensuring an optimal environment.
Additionally, we have integrated a temperature control mechanism to maintain a comfortable home environment. The LM35 sensor continuously monitors the temperature, and if it exceeds 35 degrees Celsius, the cooler is activated to cool the home until the temperature returns to normal levels.

Moreover, our project includes an automatic water tank management system. With a water tank capacity of 3000 litres, we have implemented an intelligent mechanism to handle water levels. When the water level drops to 2000 litres, the inlet valve opens automatically, and the motor starts to fill the tank. Once the water level reaches 3000 litres, the inlet valve closes, ensuring efficient utilization of resources.

To achieve these functionalities, we have utilized Picsimlab, a versatile tool for simulating and testing microcontroller-based projects. We have also incorporated a serial water tank model, which accurately emulates the behavior of a real water tank, enabling precise control and monitoring.

Overall, our IoT-based home automation system, developed with meticulous SDLC processes, offers convenience, energy efficiency, and resource optimization. We are proud of our team's efforts in creating this advanced and practical solution, and we look forward to further enhancements and applications in the realm of home automation.
